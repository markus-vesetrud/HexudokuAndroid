    <string name="About">
        This app showcases a variant of sudoku that makes use of hexagons instead of squares.
        It is made by a student of computer science at NTNU, Norway.
        The idea for this game came about while I was thinking about sudoku\'s, after having watched
        CGP Grey\'s video "Hexagons are the Bestagons". Later I found out the concept (of course)
        already existed, but it was not implemented in an actual game before. Which meant I had
        fun developing my own algorithms for solving and generating new hexudoku\'s, although it
        took several tries with different concepts.
